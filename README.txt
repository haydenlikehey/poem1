# poem1
Hello
I don't know how markup works yet
Maybe this is a bridge or it's a funny little idea, or maybe someone has already done it before
This is just what I thought would be nice
If you wish to compile the poem, but do not have a compiler installed on your machine,
Please go to the URL "https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/trycpp.asp?filename=demo_compiler",
copy the text contained within the poem1.cpp file, paste it in the interpreter at the
URL, then run the code.
Enjoy
